FlashyCards
===========

  A project originally started by Ryan and Jake in March 2014 at the HackNC Hackathon.
  Currently being developed by Sean (Kritarie).

  Created decks of flashcards are stored locally to the device via SQL. Create a Deck via the top-right Action Bar button and     give it a name. Press the pencil icon to edit a deck and add cards, or press the X to delete it.
  
  Press a deck from your list of created decks to begin studying. Slide between the front and back of each card and use the       check / X buttons to notify the app whether or not you got the correct answer. The app will psuedo-randomly select cards from   the deck to be studied while prefering cards you have trouble with.
